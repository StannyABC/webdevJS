# webdevJS
University First Year Web Development assessment, first introduction to JavaScript. Submitted 16/05/2025.
Initial use of CSS and HTML without the aid of additional external stylesheets which I have been using up till this project.

The solution allows the user to select a book on the index page, redirect to accept card details (only mastercard) and then runs the inputted data through an api, returning accepted or declined dependant on the api result.
